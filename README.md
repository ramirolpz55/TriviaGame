# TriviaGame-

I will create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. 

After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. 

Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. 

Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
